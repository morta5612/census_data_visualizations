___

This project shows the process for requesting data from several geography levels of census data on
household computer access and broadband internet subscriptions. This data is placed into Pandas Dataframes
and is significantly cleaned up and wrangled to be used in other notebooks. Plotly is used to visualize
the data in separate notebooks. GEOJson files are included where needed for more specific boundaries where
needed. In addition, a data file for NC counties is also provided.
